# Project Brief — Mission Control Repository Hardening

## Objective
Bring the Mission Control repository to external-ready standard (documentation, governance, quality gates, CI, release discipline).

## Problem
Current repo is productive but not fully contributor-ready: documentation is fragmented, quality gates are noisy/failing, and governance artefacts are incomplete.

## Outcome
A professional, externally shareable repository with clear onboarding, robust quality checks, and documented release workflow.

## Success Criteria
- Canonical README + docs index + contribution/security guidance in place
- Lint/test/typecheck/build pathways reliable and documented
- CI workflow active for pull requests
- Governance artefacts (templates, code owners, policy docs) added
