# Project: Mission Control Simplification & Completion

## Objective
Transform Mission Control into a clean, intuitive, autonomous project system.

## Definition of Done

### 1. Structural Cleanliness
- No contaminated card descriptions (no system logs, PRDs, emails, or debug text)
- Only structured task data visible on cards
- Archive / Delete / Restore visible and working
- No hidden execution gates blocking task movement

### 2. Workflow Clarity
- Board flow: Backlog → Todo → In Progress → Review → Done
- Project Process runs only on In Progress tasks
- Archive isolated from active workflow
- Clear state transitions logged but not restrictive

### 3. UX Simplicity
- No redundant tabs
- No confusing automation
- All actions visible and predictable
- Clean card layout

### 4. Autonomy Capability
- Gideon can:
  - Create tasks
  - Plan next actions
  - Execute process
  - Update status
  - Deliver without friction

### 5. End-to-End Validation
- Create task
- Move across board
- Run project process
- Archive
- Restore
- Delete permanently
- Validate DB integrity

## Current State Assessment

Execution gate: PRESENT
Archive UI issues: PRESENT
Card contamination: PRESENT
Board complexity: HIGH
Autonomy friction: HIGH

## Iteration Loop
1. Audit
2. Simplify
3. Test
4. Refactor
5. Validate
6. Repeat until Definition of Done satisfied
